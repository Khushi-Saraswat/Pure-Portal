# 🌤️ Temperature Shower (AI Weather App)

A smart weather application built using **Java + JavaFX + Spring Boot**, which shows **live temperature and weather details** using an **external Weather API**.  
It also supports **offline mode**, stores last fetched weather data, and uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate a short weather summary and warnings.
